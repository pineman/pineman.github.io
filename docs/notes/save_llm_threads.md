amp code: open in web -\> top right 'Unlisted' -\> Copy as markdown.
comes with tool usages tho open code: ctrl-p 'Export session transcript
ctrl+x x' -\> dont include anything extra (tab to move, space to select)
-\> enter gemini aistudio: files on gdrive are just json, could write an
exporter to markdown

the best would be to have a place that centralizes all this, works in
mobile, and provides pretty copy as markdown. is that chatbox? problem:
gemini api key doesn't have the same generous free tier as aistudio for
some reason. its confusing.
