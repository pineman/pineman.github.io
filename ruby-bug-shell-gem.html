<p>I'm using <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> for syntax highlighting in this blog, client-side. I was looking to pre-compute it statically, so I wrote a little node.js helper that reads stdin, highlights the html using the library, and prints to stdout (not only is it more unixy, I already have too many temp files being created). So to call it from ruby, I found the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/shell">shell gem</a>. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> It used to be in the stdlib and the DSL syntax is super cool, with me being a rubyist now and all.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried it and it seemed to work. However, since I was prototyping, I put the <code>require</code> statement right next to its usage, in a loop. When I tried hoisting it outside, where <code>require</code> normally goes, the script started raising an error:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>.../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:261:in `close': uninitialized stream (IOError)
    from .../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:261:in `block (4 levels) in sfork'
    from .../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:259:in `each_object'
    from .../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:259:in `block (3 levels) in sfork'
    from .../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:251:in `fork'
    from .../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:251:in `block (2 levels) in sfork'
    from .../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:64:in `synchronize'
    from .../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:64:in `block_output_synchronize'
    from .../3.1.0/gems/shell-0.8.1/lib/shell/process-controller.rb:243:in `block in sfork'</code></pre>
<p>That is... strange? I try and look for usages of this gem on <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/search">sourcegraph</a>, but my code seems okay. So I look into the gem's code. It essentially forks and then closes all IO objects except stdin/out/err, and it's failing to close some of them. I attempt to debug the script, but it fails due to the IO objects closing and the debugger losing connection! <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I play with the gem's code, writing debug output to a file directly, resulting in a list of the IO objects the gem's trying to close, marking the one that fails. I don't know where the failing object comes from though, as I only have an hex address, so I come with the idea of monkey-patching <code>IO#initialize</code> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> to try and match up the IO objects. This doesn't help, as the IO object that fails to <code>close</code> doesn't show up in my debug log. I then try essentially the same idea using <code>rbtrace</code> with <code>rbtrace -p $(pgrep ruby) -m 'IO#initialize(self, __source__)'</code>. Still, no avail.</p>
<p>I then try various ruby versions, since the shell gem is a bit outdated or infrequently updated. Aha! It starts failing on 3.1.0, but succeeds on 3.0.6. Maybe the gem just hasn't been updated to work on ruby 3.1.0. I look through the release notes looking for nuances regarding IO objects or fork behavior, but nothing. Could this be a ruby bug...?</p>
<p>I get an idea: I'll compile ruby with debug symbols, hoping that I can inspect the IO object that fails. This turns out to be slightly tricky and the binary I build is missing many things (probably missing lots of configure flags), so I use ruby-build and its env vars. This works - I can debug ruby (using <code>lldb</code>), create a breakpoint in <code>io.c</code>, where <code>close</code> is implemented, and inspect the object at the address I got earlier. I print some bytes off the pointer, and the only interesting thing I see is the string <code>pandoc</code>, which I am running using the backticks method to convert markdown to html. This gives me a clue that the IO object is coming from the backticks method somehow <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, somewhere, but I want to be completely sure.</p>
<p>I realize I'm in a nice VM environment - it ought to be instrumentable and introspectable, right? So I use <code>ObjectSpace.dump_all(output: io)</code> to dump all objects, and cross-ref with address of the failed IO object from my debug log. I get something like this:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>{"address":"0x101315888", "type":"FILE", "class":"0x10109ea50", "file":"./build.rb", "line":14, "method":"`", "generation":16, "memsize":40}</code></pre>
<p>And line 14 is exactly where I call <code>pandoc</code> using backticks. <code>0x10109ea50</code> is the <code>IO</code> class object.</p>
<p>Eventually I create a minimal reproduction case calling backticks and the 4 lines of code from the gem. I find that inserting <code>GC.start</code> just before calling the loop makes it succeed! Could this really be a bug in ruby? <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?CompilerBug">Do those really exist</a>? A mere mortal like me couldn't find one. Nonetheless, I have to do something about it. The shell gem looks a bit inactive, and I've extracted the offending code anyway to a nice repro case of only 5 lines. The code makes sense to run in a forked process...</p>
<p>So, after careful deliberation, I decide to open a <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19624">bug in ruby</a>! Amazingly, it gets a reply in just 3 hours on a Sunday! Looks like Nobuyoshi Nakada indeed considered it a bug in MRI, and even implemented a pretty smart test case. Truly a testament to async open source as the great software development model of the world, as an old friend reminded me, after I kept him waiting for beers as I was typing out the bug report very nervously :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 20/09/2023</strong>: Turns out it wasn't a bug in ruby after all!... I'll declare this as "not my fault" as I explicitly asked if the code was incorrect ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>All in all, a pretty cool win for me, even if I couldn't actually fix the (microscopic!) bug myself, and it took a whole weekend! Hopefully this kicks off a series of open source contributions for me :)</p>
