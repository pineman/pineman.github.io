<p>amp code: open in web -&gt; top right 'Unlisted' -&gt; Copy as markdown. comes with tool usages tho open code: ctrl-p 'Export session transcript ctrl+x x' -&gt; dont include anything extra (tab to move, space to select) -&gt; enter gemini aistudio: files on gdrive are just json, could write an exporter to markdown</p>
<p>the best would be to have a place that centralizes all this, works in mobile, and provides pretty copy as markdown. is that chatbox? problem: gemini api key doesn't have the same generous free tier as aistudio for some reason. its confusing.</p>
