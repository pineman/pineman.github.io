<p>Ok hi! One of my first projects ever was a <a href="https://github.com/pineman/code/tree/main/old_proj/pineblog">blog written in python flask</a> (please don't look at it, it was 2015). Even though I shut it down a couple of months after having it up on my server (a VPS at the time), my admiration for blogging didn't stop and, of course, I read a bazillion blog posts since then. But now, here we are, finally! My own tech blog, v2.0. Just some flat hand-made HTML files to start this time, maybe some templating soon, then we'll see. I'm also deliberately putting only a medium amount of effort on this writing, at best, otherwise I'll end up not writing anything. Trying to keep it real simple, so my brain thinks it's easy and does it. I'll take this opportunity to share some of my favorite blogs, from people I admire (this excludes of course eng. blogs from companies like netflix, dropbox, twitter, cloudflare, ...):</p>

<p>But onwards to today's topic!</p>
<p>So this year I'm yet again trying to follow through on Advent of Code, instead of... forgetting about it on day two, as with the past <em>whatever</em> years. As I read <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3">day three's statement</a>, I immediately thought of the "obvious" O(n^2) solution: for each item in the first compartment, check if it's in the second compartment - on the first hit, sum its priority and break (this description is almost executable python of course, but I'm solving this year entirely in Go for now).</p>
<p>So here's the problem, and why I'm writing this: I promptly decided not to implement this solution, without a second more of consideration. My intuition always steers away from O(n^2), as it's usually the fastest (slowest?) way to fail an interview problem. So I wanted to be smarter. And, for some reason, my intution also thinks sets are really smart (probably from solving leetcode in python, plus hash tables are amazing). So, a-ha, idea: build a set for each compartment, and intersect them. Building a set should be O(n), intersecting them should be linear as well <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, and voilà! Linear time without "ugly" for loops (... in python, which I guess is my brain's default language). So I eagerly went along, and implemented my set-based solution (in Go, which doesn't have sets in the stdlib, which I just found out). Turns out that in part two, I had to implement a three-way set intersection, which I solved by refactoring my intersection function to be more generic and chaining calls to it. Annoying, but I did it.</p>
<p>I suspect by now everyone sees the problem with this reasoning, that of course I didn't at the time. <strong>The big-oh justification I just wrote is all wrong!</strong> Maybe not in a theoretical sense, but in a practical sense (but probably in a theoretical sense as well): this problem is so simple, its volume of data so small and well crafted, that just the map overhead is overwhelming! Or, at least, cpu time complexity is not the whole story, because I didn't even think about memory access! Or yet some other reason I clearly missed! Because here's the proof: using a bigger input <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and using <code>go test -bench</code>, my set solution takes 5.42 seconds to solve part two (not counting reading the input file and turning it into an array of string), while the 'naive', 'dumb', more procedural solution runs in 139ms (more on this solution later). That's a ~39x speedup (!!). And that's pretty slow: I saw some rust and C++ going at just ~10ms for part two, another order of magnitude faster. So, I took this opportunity to profile my Go code. Find all my (bad) code <a href="https://github.com/pineman/AoC2022/blob/main/2022/day3/three.go#L48">on github</a>.</p>

<p>These are the resources I followed: <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/24/profiling-go-with-pprof/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/24/profiling-go-with-pprof/</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/blog/pprof">https://go.dev/blog/pprof</a> (in fact, the first half of this latter link describes exactly the problem I had: using a map when an array is sufficient). Of course, my code today is contrived and basically holds no mystery. But nonetheless, all I had to do was run <code>go test -bench</code> with the <code>-cpuprofile</code> and <code>-memprofile</code> flags, as I already had benchmark functions in my test file. This produces output files that <code>go tool pprof</code> can read and then generate output in text, or even png or pdf. Here's the cpu time breakdown, generated with <code>go tool pprof -top -cum cpu.out</code>, for part two only (truncated):</p>

<p>Nothing much to say here. 70% of time comparing characters, which is the core of what we want to do, anyway, and not much extra memory consumption compared to the input file size. For extra fun, here's the svg files <code>pprof</code> can generate, for the slow version: <a href="assets/profile001.svg">cpu</a>, <a href="assets/profile002.svg">mem</a>; and for the fast version: <a href="assets/profile003.svg">cpu</a>, <a href="assets/profile004.svg">mem</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">"Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast."</a> - I know this! Normally I'd like to think I do this (or, at least, when 'making it work' doesn't involve a huge amount of tech debt I guess). Also: measure before you optimize! Performance assumptions are sometimes hard to make out of intuition. Also also: <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">something something premature optimization</a> (I love computer science quotes). <strong>SO WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS FROM THE START?</strong> Why did I chase "full generality" just for the sake of it? I have no answers for you, dear reader. It might even be an unconfortable answer for me. I'm half blaming it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">mental priming</a>, and the fact that I'm using AoC2022 to learn Go (after "learning Go" twice in the last three years) - so it makes sense to implement more things, in more generality, to learn more about the language; and indeed I did that for day one and two, even though I couldn't resist the temptation of writing a <a href="https://github.com/pineman/aoc/blob/main/2022/day1/python/one_oneliner.py">one liner in python for day one</a>. Still, it hurts a little... But that's not all.</p>
<p>When I finish solving a day, I go and browse other people's solutions to compare to mine. I open an image with maybe 30 lines of code. As I read it, I realize: hey, this is exactly the same as my solution, but taking out all the set logic! It's even well commented. Instead of building a set for each compartment and then intersecting them, just directly check if each item of the first is in the second and third. "Right, I thought of this solution. It even looks exactly the same as mine, bar two lines of code", I said to myself, half proudly still. "It's gotta be slower". So I implement it. And it's faster. 39x faster. And this is the real kick in the teeth: <strong>the solution I was looking at was written by <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></strong>. At first I didn't know how to feel. Some thirty minutes in, and I find my solution is stupid and completely obliterated by an AI that took just 2 seconds to do it... Welp, after <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33847479">reading up more on ChatGPT</a>, I'm convinced it won't put me out of a job just yet, or even next year. But in the next 10, 20 years?... I'm much more anxious.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Assuming lookup is O(1)... approximately. Of course, it's more like amortized cost - in a terrible hash table (or just a terrible day or input) buckets are arrays, and using a terrible hash function all items end up in the same bucket, so the cost starts to look a lot more like O(n) due to linear searches, and intersection goes more like O(n^2) (maybe O(nlog n) using un-sorted trees).
